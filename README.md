# AframeHolidayCard
Some experiments with WebXR using Aframe. The code needs to be run from a server (not locally in the browser). Upon running, the [Hiro marker](https://github.com/artoolkit/ARToolKit5/blob/master/doc/patterns/Hiro%20pattern%20with%20border.pdf) should be scanned using the camera for the correct placement of objects.
